You may have heard that if you have been convicted of a felony, you are not eligible to receive financial aid. This is not necessarily true. A student convicted for the possession or sale of illegal drugs may have eligibility suspended if the offense occurred while the student was receiving federal student aid (grants, loans, or work-study). When you complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), you will be asked whether you had a drug conviction for an offense that occurred while you were receiving federal student aid. If the answer is yes, you will be provided a special worksheet to help you determine whether your conviction affects your eligibility for federal student aid. You may preview the worksheet in the FAFSA Information section at www.studentaid.ed.gov/pubs. If you have been convicted of a forcible or nonforcible sexual offense, and you are subject to an involuntary civil commitment upon completion of a period of incarceration for that offense, you are ineligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant.","","gedtestingservice.com","","",""

"","Asian American Recovery Services","","Our primary goal is to change an individual's substance-abusing lifestyle. This change comes about through four fundamental processes. First, individuals must acknowledge their problems, their own roles and responsibilities in abusing substances. Second, they must have the willingness to resolve and change their substance abusing behavior. Third, there needs to be an understanding and reconciliation of any conflict within themselves, their families and cultural traditions. Finally, they need to develop abilities and skills in managing their lives in the social, economic and political reality of their environment and community. The AARS-residential is a therapeutic community which recognizes the need for providing structure, support and opportunity within a multi-cultural environment. It is a highly structured environment with defined boundaries, both moral and ethical. The program employs community imposed sanctions as well as earned advancement of status and privileges as part of the recovery and growth process.

CJRW re-weaves the web of relationships that have been torn apart by crime and the policies of the criminal justice system. Get on the Bus is a program of The Center for Restorative Justice Works. Get On The Bus brings children and their guardians/caregivers from throughout the state of California to visit their mothers and fathers in prison. An annual event, Get On The Bus offers free transportation for the children and their caregivers to the prison, provides travel bags for the children, comfort care bags for the caregivers, a photo of each child with his or her parent, and meals for the day (breakfast, snacks on the bus, lunch at the prison, and dinner on the way home) — all at no cost to the children’s family. On the bus trip home, following a four-hour visit, each child receives a teddy bear with a letter from their parent and post-event counseling.  www.crjw.us     www.getonthebus.us","","","","Southern California Office","","(818) 980-7714 Fax: (818) 980-7702","","info@getonthebus.us","","Monday – Friday, 9:00am to 5:00pm Intake Tuesday – Friday.","","6400 Laurel Canyon Blvd. Ste 304","","","No referral needed.
