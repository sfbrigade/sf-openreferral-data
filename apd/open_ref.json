First Avenues Move-In Assistance grants are one-time only. Deposits can be accessed for housing located both in and outside of San Francisco. Eligibility Criteria: • Family unit with legal custody of minor children • Homeless, must provide appropriate documentation i.e. Certification of Homelessness • Moving within or from San Francisco. • Family has sufficient resources to pay monthly rent. Rental Subsidy Program: The First Avenues Rental Subsidy Program is targeted towards working families in San Francisco. Families may be in shelter or in housing on the verge of homelessness. The Rental Subsidy Program provides eligible families with monthly rental assistance for3-24 months. Families must demonstrate an ability to increase their income by at least the amount of the subsidy and recertify quarterly for eligibility, need and progress. This subsidy is used to enhance each family’s employment goals and maintain their housing goals as they move towards self-sufficiency. Families pay 50% of their monthly income towards rent and the rental assistance maximum per family is $800 per month. The rental subsidy is only applicable to market rate and affordable housing options; it cannot be applied to subsidized options like housing authority where the family’s rental amount is determined by a percentage of their income. Families enrolled in this program receive home-based support services* for the duration of their financial assistance. Eligibility Criteria: •  Family is living in a shelter or transitional housing program in San Francisco or is housed in San Francisco and at risk of losing their housing; •  Have a household member who is working part or full-time, and/or families on Cal Works who are transitioning into work; •  If the family did not receive the subsidy they would be paying over 50% of their income toward rent; •  Income must be less than 50% AMI in San Francisco; •  Family has the ability to increase their monthly income and take over the full rent by the end of the program term. Eviction Prevention Program: First Avenues Eviction Prevention assistance is a one time, maximum $1,500 grant to families and individuals facing imminent eviction and subsequent homelessness. The grant must prevent an eviction and avert the family or individual from entering shelter. First Avenues Eviction Prevention targets households who are at risk of eviction and who would be able to retain their housing with one-time rental assistance. Households receive follow up phone calls to ensure that they have remained stably housed. Eligibility Criteria: •  Must have a legal lease •  W-9 from the landlord (or can obtain one from the landlord) •  Eviction Notice (within 30 days) •  Ability to pay rent forward. Households need to call the Eviction Prevention Specialist at 415-614-9060 ext. 114"

Called “a company with a conscience,” it was founded in 1984 by social activist and entrepreneur Peter Cover.   America Works' guiding principle is the belief that the best way to lift people out of poverty is to help them find a job—real private sector jobs.  In other words, it believes that work first works best.  Clients must be referred by San Francisco Adult Probation.No."

The comprehensive approach stresses offender accountability and violence prevention education. Referrals are required. No first-time drop-ins.No.No referrals needed. Drop-ins are welcome.
